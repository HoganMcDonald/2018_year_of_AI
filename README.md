# 2018_year_of_AI

A year ago, I decided to begin my journey into software engineering. I felt like I was at a personal dead end, and I wasn't sure what I was passionate about. I wanted to find a new direction to go in my career that was challenging and exciting.

I had always been curious about code, but felt intimidated to learn. I felt as though I had missed out on my opportunity years prior. One year later, and I can see that I was very wrong about that.

My new challenge is making a decision about what to study while being faced with the almost endless opportunities in this industry. An area of Computer Science that I have been interested in since the beginning is machine learning.

Some of the first projects that I *attempted* were based on very basic machine learning concepts. I was instantly curious about genetic algorithms and felt like I could understand them, but neural networks seemed lightyears ahead.

Coming into 2018, I have decided to make a commitment to learning machine learning. I am going to attempt to spend at least some time (~15+ mins) each day dedicated to learning machine learning. To help keep myself accountable, I am going to post about it here.

Thank you for taking the time to read, I hope that when this is all done, that this repo can serve as inspiration for you to pursue AI or any other field you want to learn more about.

The first week was a lot of fun. In a moment of inspiration, I created this repo. My hope is that this will turn into a motivating tool for me. I may eventually transition this to a blog, not sure.

My experience with AI is limited. Last year, after learning web development, I knew I wanted to do something with data science. Without knowing what I was doing, I started Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai course. I believe I was in the first or second class. A couple weeks after starting, I saw Wired publish content about the class. It was crazy to me that in less than a month, I could understand language that was completely foreign to me not long prior.

I also competed in the Twin Cities Startup Week Hack for Change event in 2017 and placed second. In that competition, as the sole developer on my team (alongside my partner [Joel](http://http://joellueders.com)), I built a model that could predict a user's time and day of death precise to the ms using historical data from the CDC. It felt like magic. We accomplished this by using Nexosis, an ML API designed to be accessible for developers. It was a ton of fun working with the Nexosis Data Scientists to put together such a fun app.

I have started out my return to AI by enrolling in deeplearning.ai - Convolutional Neural Networks. I wanted to hit the ground running while I did research about a more concrete study plan going forward. Here's to another great week.

I continued with my course on CNNs this week. I am currently working on my first custom CNN model for image classification. I haven't learned about backward propagation in CNNs yet.

A few questions that I have pertain to the effectiveness of pooling layers. I understand that there are multiple popular explanations for why they are so effective, but they all seem to fall short. It seems like there is a lot of data loss in a pooling layer. It reduces the resolution of volumes of parameters in deeper layers of the network.

I will be curious to see how they affect models as I do more hands on work.

I also picked up the book *Data Science from Scratch* by Grus and am enjoying it so far. It is a good introductory volume on data science and is helping to fill in a lot of the holes in my compsci and math knowledge that will help me moving forward.

### Week 3
January 17th - 23rd
