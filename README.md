# 2018_year_of_AI

A year ago, I decided to begin my journey into software engineering. I felt like I was at a personal dead end, and I wasn't sure what I was passionate about. I wanted to find a new direction to go in my career that was challenging and exciting.

I had always been curious about code, but felt intimidated to learn. I felt as though I had missed out on my opportunity years prior. One year later, and I can see that I was very wrong about that.

My new challenge is making a decision about what to study while being faced with the almost endless opportunities in this industry. An area of Computer Science that I have been interested in since the begining is machine learning.

Some of the first projects that I *attempted* were based on very basic machine learning concepts. I was instantly curious about genetic algorithms and felt like I could understand them, but neural networks seemed lightyears ahead.

Coming into 2018, I have decided to make a commitment to learning machine learning. I am going to attempt to spend at least some time (~15+ mins) each day dedicated to learning machine learning. To help keep myself accountable, I am going to post about it here.

Thank you for taking the time to read, I hope that when this is all done, that this repo can serve as inspiration for you to pursue AI or any other field you want to learn more about.
